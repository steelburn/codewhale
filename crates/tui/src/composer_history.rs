//! Cross-session composer input history (#366).
//!
//! Persists user-typed prompts to `~/.deepseek/composer_history.txt` so
//! pressing Up-arrow at the composer recalls submissions from previous
//! sessions, not just the current one. One entry per line, oldest first,
//! capped at [`MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES`] entries (older entries are pruned
//! at append time).
//!
//! Entries that begin with `/` (slash commands) are NOT stored — they
//! pollute the recall stream and the fuzzy slash-menu already covers
//! them. Empty / whitespace-only inputs are also skipped.
//!
//! ## Off-thread writes (#1927)
//!
//! [`append_history`] used to block the caller for a read-then-atomic-
//! rewrite of the full file. That ran on the UI thread inside
//! `submit_input`, contributing a perceptible stall after Enter. The
//! public entry point now hands work to a dedicated writer thread via
//! [`writer_sender`] and returns immediately. Submissions stay serialised
//! in arrival order, so the on-disk file keeps its "oldest first"
//! invariant.
